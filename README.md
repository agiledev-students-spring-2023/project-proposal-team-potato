## Project title

WillEats 

## What and why?

In reality, it is always hard for the customers to visualize the dishes from plain texts on the menu. So every time they order is like making aguess.Besides, during the time with high-volume, customers often find it hard to find a waiter for them ot order or pay the check. To address these problems, the restaurant owners must hire more waiter and make the menu longer traditionally. In order to improve this situation for both the customers and the resturants, we have WillEats, which is a online ordering platform that enables customers to view the dishes in a restaurant same as shopping on Amazon - each dish would be accompanied with picutres and comments. Payments and tips could also be made online if the restaurant enables that option. Detailed setting would be made by the restaurant owners, including pictures, prices, dish genres, comments availablity, and payment account.

## For whom?

The app is for the restaurants that needs to improve their efficiency of ordering and payment or they want to hire less people.

## How?

As customers, images and price of each dish would be presented as choice. Customers would be able add them into the shopping-cart and make subsequent payment or not(choose by the restaurant). They could make comments on the dishes after payment if the feature is enabled by the restaurant. Past orders can be seen by the specific customer if they have had ordered before. 

As restaurant managers, the details about menu could be set up manually. They could upload pictures about the dish, set the price of it, and classify it into a specific genre. If they feel confident about their dishes, comments would be the best feature for them to exhibit the appreciation from customers. Managers could select to disable online payment if they think it not-secured to do online payment, which may lead to higher unpayment rate.
## Scope

The front-ended app would not be very complex because of the properties of this app is basically simple. However, the back-ended app would require a role assignment to each account that has been created, which makes disegining the database structure a little more complicated because the dataabse would have to corresponds the back-end code.
