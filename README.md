## What and why?

In reality, it often takes a while to go through the menu and order the food during the time with high-volume of customers. In order to improve this situation for both the customers and the resturants, we plan to make a software that improves the efficiency of ordering and payment. 

## For whom?

The app is for the restaurants that needs to improve their efficiency of ordering and payment or they want to hire less people.

## How?

As a customer, images and price of each dish would be presented as choice. Customers would be able add them into the shopping-cart and make subsequent payment or not(by choice of the restaurant). Past orders can be seen by the specific customer if they have had ordered something before. 
As a restaurant manager, menus could be updated by mananager as well as the prices. Payment system can be set up. 
## Scope

The front-ended app would not be very complex because of the properties of this app is basically simple. However, the back-ended app would require a role assignment to each account that has been created, which makes disegining the database structure a little more complicated because the dataabse would have to corresponds the back-end code.
